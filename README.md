## Motivation

Many people, when buying homes often focus on the price, or at the very most, the price and hearsay from friends and neighbors, they never really search for insight into a specific neighborhood or place, and part of the reason for that is due to the large variety of data, and disjointed it is. Living-Insight solves this problem by creating a data pipeline that connects its users to all of this data.
